### Protein Sources
- Legumes: lentils, chickpeas, black beans

- Tofu & tempeh
- Nuts & seeds (almonds, pumpkin seeds)
- Whole grain bread with peanut butter

### Carbohydrates (Endurance Focus)
- Oats, quinoa, brown rice

                <td class="output"><pre># Nutrition Plan for Marathon Training

## Key Challenge
Training for a 42km race in just 2 weeks is **extremely aggressive**. This timing is risky—most marathon training requires 16-20 weeks. Focus on recovery and avoiding injury rather than peak performance.

## Daily Caloric Needs
- Base metabolic rate: ~1,700 calories
- With marathon training: **3,000-3,500 calories/day**

## Macronutrient Targets
- **Carbs**: 55-60% (410-525g) — fuel for long runs
- **Protein**: 15-20% (113-175g) — muscle recovery
- **Fat**: 20-25% (67-97g) — sustained energy

## Recommended Foods

### Carbohydrate Sources
- Oats, quinoa, brown rice, sweet potatoes, pasta
- Whole grain bread, bananas, berries, dates

### Protein Sources (Vegetarian)
- Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, tofu, tempeh
- Nuts, seeds, peanut butter, hemp seeds
- Vegan protein powder (pea/soy-based)

### Healthy Fats
- Olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, nut butters

### Dairy Alternatives (Lactose-free)
- Oat milk, soy milk, almond milk fortified with calcium/B12

## Race Week Strategy
- Taper training volume (reduce distance)
- Increase carbs 2-3 days before race
- Stay hydrated (2-3L water daily)
- Eat familiar foods during the race

**Consider consulting a sports nutritionist** for personalized timing and race-day fuel.</pre></td>
