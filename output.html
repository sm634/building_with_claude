✅ **Timing:** Carbs before/after runs; protein distributed across all meals  
✅ **Protein Sources:** Legumes, tofu, hemp/pea powder, nuts, seeds  
✅ **Budget-Friendly:** Bulk lentils/rice; seasonal vegetables; store-brand plant milk  
✅ **Hydration:** 2.5-3L water daily + electrolytes on long runs  
✅ **Flexibility:** Swap vegetables</pre></td>

The macronutrient distribution appropriately supports the dual goals of muscle building and distance running endurance. However, the solution significantly violates the secondary criterion of being 'compact and concise (under 400 words)' by including extensive supporting information, notes, and an optional snack.

It successfully includes breakfast, snacks, pre/post-workout nutrition, and begins dinner. However, the solution is critically incomplete - the dinner section cuts off mid-entry without finishing the sweet potato portion details or providing the complete macronutrient totals for that meal. While the mandatory requirements are technically present (daily caloric total stated, macro targets provided, meals with portions and timing included), the incomplete execution undermines the practical utility of the plan. An athlete cannot follow a meal plan that ends abruptly. This incompleteness is a significant deficiency that prevents a higher score despite the otherwise excellent framework.</td>

## **Customization Notes**
- If training in morning, shift meals earlier
- Adjust portions up/down by 100-200 calories based on weekly progress
- Swap</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution comprehensively addresses all mandatory requirements with precise daily totals, detailed macronutrient breakdowns, and six well-timed meals with exact portions. The protein target is exceeded appropriately for muscle recovery. However, the fat intake falls 9-19g short of the stated target range, and the incomplete ending suggests a formatting issue. Despite these minor deficiencies, the core meal plan is actionable, realistic, and strategically designed for a weightlifting athlete. The solution meets all secondary criteria regarding meal coverage, protein adequacy, training-focused timing, and practical implementation.</td>
