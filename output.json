    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The solution comprehensively addresses all mandatory requirements with precise daily totals, detailed macronutrient breakdowns, and six well-timed meals with exact portions. The protein target is exceeded appropriately for muscle recovery. However, the fat intake falls 9-19g short of the stated target range, and the incomplete ending suggests a formatting issue. Despite these minor deficiencies, the core meal plan is actionable, realistic, and strategically designed for a weightlifting athlete. The solution meets all secondary criteria regarding meal coverage, protein adequacy, training-focused timing, and practical implementation."
